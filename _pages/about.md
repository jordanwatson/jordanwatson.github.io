I love data! I love to share data, visualize it, collect it, tell stories with it, and think about creative new ways to solve problems with it. I'm a fisheries scientist at the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, based at the Auke Bay Labs in Juneau, Alaska. As part of the Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment program, I seek to understand how environmental drivers shape the distributions of fish and the fishers that target them. I use a suite of quantitative methods and types of data, and am currently focusing a great deal on creating backend database integrations for more efficient, consistent, and reliable downstream use by a broader audience. I work with a team of talented programmers that are helping me to facilitate easier data access for my colleagues and the public. This includes development of geospatial algorithms and merging satellite environmental information into fishery-dependent datasets to more easily facilitate dynamic ocean management, machine learning analyses, and understanding of environmentally-mediated shifts in fishing locations and distributions. I'm particularly interested in using these approaches to develop more robust efforts around bycatch mitigation and avoidance.
