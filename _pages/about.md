I'm a fisheries scientist at the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, based at the Auke Bay Labs in Juneau, Alaska. Part of the Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment program, we seek largely to understand how environmental information drives patterns in the marine environments. I use a suite of quantitative methods and types of data, and am currently focusing a great deal on creating backend database integrations for more efficient, consistent, and reliable downstream use by a broader variety of downstream uers. This includes development of geospatial algorithms and merging satellite environmental information into fishery-dependent datasets to more easily facilitate dynamic ocean management, machine learning analyses, and understanding of environmentally-mediated shifts in fishing locations and distributions. I'm particularly interested in using these approaches to develop more robust efforts around bycatch mitigation and avoidance.
