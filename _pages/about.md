I love data! I love to share, visualize, collect, and tell stories with data. I love to think about creative new ways to solve problems with data. And I think that data are critical for solving many of the environmental and climate challenges we face today.

Since September 2021 I have been on a leadership detail (temporary assignment) as the acting Deputy Director for the NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence (noaa.gov/ai), an exciting new NOAA effort to benefit from the opportunities and efficiencies offered by innovative data technologies like AI. I am especially inspired to work with and learn from environmental leaders to promote innovation and advance NOAA workforce capacity and to improve the ability of NOAA to meet its mission.

In my normal position, I'm a marine scientist at the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, based in Juneau. I seek to understand how environmental drivers shape the distributions of fish and the fishing fleets that target them. Such analyses are critical for marine spatial planning. I use a suite of quantitative methods and types of data, and have worked to create data systems for more efficient, consistent, and reliable downstream use by a broader audience. I work with a team of talented programmers that are helping to facilitate easier data access for my colleagues and the public. This includes development of geospatial algorithms and merging satellite environmental information into fishery-dependent datasets to facilitate dynamic ocean management, machine learning analyses, and understanding of environmentally-mediated shifts in fishing locations and distributions. I'm particularly interested in using these approaches for more robust efforts around bycatch mitigation and more broadly, sustainable resource management.  

I've been fortunate enough to conduct fieldwork on five continents, from more than a dozen countries. I've spent more than a year aboard oceanographic research vessels and nearly three years at remote field stations (mostly Antarctica and Alaska). Since 2011, most of my fieldwork has been in Alaska, from the Bering Sea to southern Baranof Island. Time in the field continues to inspire new hypotheses, observations, approaches to problem solving, and general enthusiasm for science. 

When I'm not playing with data, I love skiing (up or down) mountains, trail running, scuba diving, experimenting with new ingredients in my bread dough, and getting cambazola cheese to the perfect warm gooey-ness atop the aforementioned bread.
