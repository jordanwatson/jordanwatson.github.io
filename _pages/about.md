I have spent me career working across marine science disciplines around the globe. These experiences have inspired a passion for people, data, and scientific leadership. 

I am the Deputy Director for the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System ([PacIOOS](www.pacioos.hawaii.edu)), one of 11 regional associations that comprise the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System. I support the organizationâ€™s efforts to provide ocean data and data services to stakeholders across the Hawaiian Islands, U.S. Pacific territories, and the freely associated states. These duties range from internal and external partnership building and fiscal management to organizational operations and staffing.  

I previously spent more than ten years with NOAA Fisheries - first as a contractor at the Pacific Islands and Alaska Fisheries Science Centers (AFSC), and later as a federal scientist at the AFSC. A highlight of my time at NOAA was a six month leadership detail as the acting Deputy Director for the [NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence](noaa.gov/ai), an exciting NOAA effort to leverage innovative technologies like AI.  

At the AFSC, I was based for ten years in Juneau, Alaska. My research explored how environmental drivers shape the distributions of fish and the fishing fleets that target them. I used a suite of quantitative tools and data types and worked to build more automated data systems capable of integrating satellite data (e.g., environmental and vessel tracking information) with oceanographic, fishery survey, landings, economic, and bycatch data. 

I've spent more than a year aboard oceanographic research vessels and nearly three years at remote field stations (mostly Antarctica and Alaska). Time in the field continues to inspire new hypotheses, observations, approaches to problem solving, and general enthusiasm for science. 

When I'm not playing with data, I love skiing (up or down) mountains, trail running, scuba diving, and experimenting in the kitchen.
