I have spent my career working across marine science disciplines around the globe, inspiring a passion for people, data, and scientific leadership with an ultimate goal of ensuring that the science I do matters.

I am the Director for the Pacific Region of the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System ([CIOOS Pacific](https://cioospacific.ca/), where I have the privilege of working with regional and national teams that share the mission of making ocean data more accessible. This work builds on my previous experiences at the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System ([PacIOOS](www.pacioos.hawaii.edu)) and NOAA Fisheries. 

I spent more than a decade with NOAA Fisheries, at the Pacific Islands and Alaska Fisheries Science Centers (AFSC), as well as the [NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence](noaa.gov/ai) (NCAI). During 10 years at the AFSC (based in Juneau, Alaska), my research explored how environmental drivers shape the distributions of fish and the fishing fleets that target them. I used a suite of quantitative tools and data types and worked to build more automated data systems capable of integrating satellite data (e.g., environmental and vessel tracking information) with oceanographic, fishery survey, landings, economic, and bycatch data. A highlight of my time at NOAA was a six month leadership detail as the acting Deputy Director for the NCAI, an exciting NOAA effort to leverage innovative technologies like AI. 

I've worked in more than a dozen countries on five continents and have spent more than a year aboard oceanographic research vessels and nearly three years at remote field stations (mostly Antarctica and Alaska). Time in the field and engaging with colleagues globally has always inspired new perspectives on scientific approaches, appreciation for evolving technical capabilities, and an insatiable curiosity about the oceans.

When I'm not playing with data, I am usually skiing (up or down) mountains, trail running, scuba diving, and experimenting in the kitchen.
